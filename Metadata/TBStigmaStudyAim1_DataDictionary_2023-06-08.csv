My name is </span>[tbip_sc_staff_full_name]<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> and I work for the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation (DTHF). We would like to invite you to take part in a study we are doing in collaboration with the Eastern Cape Department of Health. The focus of this study is on tuberculosis (TB), which is a very serious problem in South Africa and the Eastern Cape. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our study aims to identify and understand how individual and community knowledge, beliefs and social norms influence TB-related care and health outcomes. You have been approached to participate because you are an index TB patient with household contacts. </span><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This consent form contains details about the study and what will be expected of you if you agree to participate. Before you agree to take part in the study, you should fully understand why this study is being done. I will go through this consent form with you, and make sure that you understand what the study is all about. If there is anything that you do not understand, please ask me to stop and I will explain it to you. If you have any other questions related to this study, please feel free to ask me. </span><br /><br />PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are conducting the survey for two main reasons: </span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">1. To identify and understand how individual and community knowledge, beliefs and social norms influence TB-related care and health outcomes</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">2. To inform possible ways to improve TB and TB/HIV health outcomes among those with TB or TB/HIV</span><br /><br />STUDY PROCEDURES <br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you agree to participate, you will first be asked to sign this consent form or make your thumb print mark to show that you are willing to take part in the study. After you agree to be part of our study, we will work with you to create a map and set of directions to your house. We will also create a detailed list of who lives with you, their contact information, and days that they can usually be found at home. After which, we will schedule a time and day that works best with your household contacts to visit them and screen them for TB. If they screen positive then we will also invite them to participate in the study.</span><br /><br />CONFIDENTIALITY<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your participation in this study will be kept confidential. We will not tell anyone about your participation; we will make every effort to protect your privacy, confidentiality, answers, and information. Your household information will be stored either on a secure, password protected computer, or in a cabinet that will be kept locked at all times in our study office. We will identify you and your household using a special number that will be assigned to you by a computer. Only authorised research staff will know what your special number is or be able to see your information. After these five years, any personal identifying information you provide will be destroyed.</span><br /><br />RISKS, BENEFITS, AND COSTS TO YOU<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We understand that by visiting your home, you may feel the need to disclose your TB status to your household contacts. If you are taking this opportunity to disclose your status for the first time, we are aware that this may be a difficult conversation. This may cause you stress, and may even be stigmatizing. If this happens, please tell us immediately so that we can provide you with support and counselling. If we cannot provide you with the support you need, we will refer you to someone who can.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Although you will not directly benefit from participating, your household members will benefit from free TB screening. If anyone in your household screens positive for signs and symptoms of TB, we will immediately refer them to the clinic for testing. Participation in this study will involve no cost to you, and you will not be paid to participate in this study. If you decide to not participate, your care or the care of your household members will not be affected.</span> <br /><br />WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Participation in this survey is voluntary, you do not need to participate if you do not want to. You can choose to not have the study team visit your house during the time leading up to the scheduled visits. You can still go to the clinic for services regardless of if you participate. </span><br /><br />PROBLEMS OR QUESTIONS <br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you ever have any questions or experience harm because of the study, please contact the Study Investigator Dr. Andrew Medina-Marino at </span>0826373793<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> or <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Andrew.Marino@hiv-research.org.za.</span> This research has been approved by the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (an independent committee established to help protect the rights of research participants).

My name is [user-fullname] and I work for the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation (DTHF). We would like to invite you to take part in a study we are doing in collaboration with the Eastern Cape Department of Health. The focus of this study is on tuberculosis (TB), which is a very serious problem in South Africa and the Eastern Cape.</span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our study aims to identify and understand how individual and community knowledge, beliefs and social norms influence TB-related care and health outcomes. You have been approached to participate because you are a household contact of someone that has been diagnosed with TB, and you yourself have signs and symptoms of TB.</span></p> <p style=""text-align: justify;""><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This consent form contains details about the study and what will be expected of you if you agree to participate. Before you agree to take part in the study, you should fully understand why this study is being done. I will go through this consent form with you, and make sure that you understand what the study is all about. If there is anything that you do not understand, please ask me to stop and I will explain it to you. If you have any other questions related to this study, please feel free to ask me.</span> <br /><br />PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are conducting the survey for two main reasons: </span><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">1. To identify and understand how individual and community knowledge, beliefs and social norms influence TB-related care and health outcomes</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">2. To inform possible ways to improve TB and TB/HIV health outcomes among those with TB or TB/HIV</span><br /><br />STUDY PROCEDURES <br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you agree to participate, you will first be asked to sign this consent form or make your thumb print mark to show that you are willing to take part in the study. After you agree to be part of our study, we will work with you to create a map and set of directions to your house. We will also create a detailed list of who lives with you, their contact information, and days that they can usually be found at home. After which, we will schedule a time and day that works best with your household contacts to visit them and screen them for TB. If they screen positive then we will also invite them to participate in the study.</span><br /><br />CONFIDENTIALITY<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your participation in this study will be kept confidential. We will not tell anyone about your participation; we will make every effort to protect your privacy, confidentiality, answers, and information. Your household information will be stored either on a secure, password protected computer, or in a cabinet that will be kept locked at all times in our study office. We will identify you and your household using a special number that will be assigned to you by a computer. Only authorised research staff will know what your special number is or be able to see your information. After these five years, any personal identifying information you provide will be destroyed.</span><br /><br />RISKS, BENEFITS, AND COSTS TO YOU<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We understand that by visiting your home, you may feel the need to disclose your TB status to your household contacts. If you are taking this opportunity to disclose your status for the first time, we are aware that this may be a difficult conversation. This may cause you stress, and may even be stigmatizing. If this happens, please tell us immediately so that we can provide you with support and counselling. If we cannot provide you with the support you need, we will refer you to someone who can.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Although you will not directly benefit from participating, your household members will benefit from free TB screening. If anyone in your household screens positive for signs and symptoms of TB, we will immediately refer them to the clinic for testing. Participation in this study will involve no cost to you, and you will not be paid to participate in this study. If you decide to not participate, your care or the care of your household members will not be affected.</span> <br /><br />WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Participation in this survey is voluntary, you do not need to participate if you do not want to. You can choose to not have the study team visit your house during the time leading up to the scheduled visits. You can still go to the clinic for services regardless of if you participate.</span> <br /><br />PROBLEMS OR QUESTIONS <br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you ever have any questions or experience harm because of the study, please contact the Study Investigator Dr. Andrew Medina-Marino at </span>0826373793<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> or</span> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""mailto:andrew.marino@hiv-research.org.za"">andrew.marino@hiv-research.org.za</a>.</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">  This research has been approved by the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (an independent committee established to help protect the rights of research participants).
